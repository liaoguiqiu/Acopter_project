# Acopter_project

rotorcraft version 2.0
-This is a C/C++ autopolit project running on stm32 F407 (The UcosII is transfered to STM32) for:

1 Reading data and do filter for Accelerometers,Gyros, Magnets, barometers,GPS,Ultrasound

2 Fusing these data to estimate the pitch,roll,yaw,angular rate,position, velocity and acceleration of UAV

3 Controller

-The configration of the micro-processor is shown as below:
